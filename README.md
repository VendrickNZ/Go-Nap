# Go Nap
Michael Alpenfels, Jakib Isherwood

## Important notes for cloning

This app depends on Google Maps API for map data. You will need to add your API key to the `MAPS_API_KEY`
property of`local.properties`.

## How to use the app 

Press and hold on the place on the map you want to create an alarm. 

You can specify a custom name and radius per alarm, or set a default in settings.

You can press on any alarm on the map to set it as active. Active alarms are red. 

Entering the radius of the active alarm will then send an alarm notification to you to wake up, and deactivate
the alarm.

From the My Alarms page, you can press any alarm to see where it is on the map. Swiping left on an alarm
in the list will show a delete button. You can also press the share icon to share the alarm to your 
friends in any messaging app. This will create a link that they can click that deep links to GoNap's 
create alarm screen, and will prepopulate the create alarm with the data from the link.

### Important Note for deep linking

Because we do not actually own the domain `www.gonap.nz`, deep linking will need to be manually connected
by the user in their android settings. This can be done by going `Apps > Go Nap > Defaults | Set as default > Supported web addresses` 
then enable `www.gonap.nz`. You should also make sure that `Open supported links` is enabled.
